# Natnael's Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website showcasing the work, skills, and contact information of **Natnael Yohanes**. The current progress includes the completion of the HTML structure for the website, detailing various sections and content placeholders.

## Features of the HTML Implementation

1. **Navigation Bar:**

   - A simple navigation bar that links to key sections of the website: Home, About, Services, Projects, and Contact.

2. **Contact Information:**

   - Includes a section displaying:
     - Email address: **mataniayohanes@gmail.com**
     - Physical address: **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia**
   - Icons are used to visually represent each type of information.

3. **Contact Form:**

   - A basic form for visitors to provide feedback or make inquiries:
     - Fields for name, email, contact number, and suggestions.
     - A `Submit` button for sending the form data (currently functional as a placeholder).

4. **Footer:**

   - Highlights key details, including:
     - Name and profession: **Natnael Yohanes - Software Engineer**
     - Contact details (phone and email).
     - Social media links for LinkedIn, WhatsApp, GitHub, Discord, and X (formerly Twitter).
     - Each social media link includes an icon for visual representation.

5. **W3C HTML Validation:**
   - The HTML has been validated using [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), ensuring it adheres to web standards and is free of major errors or warnings.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To structure the website content.
- **Icons**: Included from a local `./images/icons` directory.

## Next Steps

The following steps are planned for the project:

1. Styling the website using **CSS** to enhance its visual appearance and layout.
2. Adding **JavaScript** for interactivity, such as form validation or smooth scrolling.
3. Setting up **backend functionality** to handle form submissions and process user inputs.
